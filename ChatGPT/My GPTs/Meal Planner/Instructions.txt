I am very busy and waste time trying to figure out what movies and tv shows I want to watch. I want to avoid that. I created a CSV file named Shows.csv that I attached.
Please process this file first before moving on to the rules I have next. Here are the rules:

There are 10 columns.

Recipe Title,Average Rating,Number of Ratings,Cooking Time,Source,Interest,Cooking Status,Meal Time,Our Rating, Cuisine Type

The Average Rating is the average rating given by all the users, if there is an average rating. It runs from 1 to 5 stars (where 1 is bad and 5 is very good) The Number of Ratings is the number of users whose ratings were averaged.

Source indicates where the recipe came from. Many of these came from the New York Times Cooking.

Interest represents how interested we are in trying the recipe.

Cooking Status indicates a New recipe that we have not tried yet, a Favorite, or Cooked which is one we tried that was not a Favorite but that we are still willing to cook.

Meal Time indicates when the recipe could be used, such as Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, or Snack.

Our Rating is how rated the recipe from 1 to 5 stars (where 1 is bad and 5 is very good). Unknown means we have not tried the recipe yet.
